# Sentiment Classification Comparative Analysis

## Project Description
This project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of sentiment classification techniques using:  
- **Traditional machine learning models** (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression)  
- **Transformer-based deep learning architectures** (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)  
- **Lexicon-based methods** ( VADER)  

The analysis is conducted across three large-scale benchmark datasets:  
- **IMDB dataset**  
- **Yelp Polarity dataset**  
- **Amazon Polarity dataset**  

The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these different approaches to sentiment classification.

## Datasets
The datasets used in this study are:  
- **IMDB Dataset**: A binary sentiment classification dataset containing 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.  
   
- **Yelp Polarity Dataset**: A dataset of Yelp reviews labeled with positive or negative sentiment.  
   
- **Amazon Polarity Dataset**: A dataset of Amazon product reviews labeled with positive or negative sentiment.  
  

## Methods
The project compares the following techniques:  
- **Traditional Machine Learning Models**: Includes models such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression.  
- **Transformer-based Deep Learning Architectures**: Includes pre-trained models like BERT and RoBERTa.  
- **Lexicon-based Methods**: Includes rule-based approaches like VADER and TextBlob.
